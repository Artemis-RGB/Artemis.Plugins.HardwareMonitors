Repository containing hardware monitoring plugins

# Download
These plugins can be downloaded through the Artemis in-app workshop.

## Supported methods of monitoring

### HWiNFO64
This is generally the preferred method as it is the most performant and gives the most information.

### Open/Libre Hardware Monitor 
Slightly less efficient than the HWiNFO one, but still very good.

### Aida64 
This plugin is more limited than the other ones because the API used does not provide as much detail. 

### Standalone 
This plugin does not require any other programs to be running to work, however it does require administrator privileges.
